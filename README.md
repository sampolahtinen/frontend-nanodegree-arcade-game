Arcade Game
===============================
Classical Arcade game - avoid enemies that try to eat you!

## How to play
Move by using arrow keys. If you hit the walls, naturally you can't go beyond. If you get to the top, you will score 10 points and move back to starting position. You win the game if you reach 100 points. You lose the game if you get hit three times by the bugs.

## Notes
1. Bugs' speed updates randomly each time they hit the right end of the board.
2. Hearts will pop up randomly. If you manage to get to the heart, you will gain +1 lives.
