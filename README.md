Arcade Game
===============================
Classical Arcade game - avoid enemies that try to eat you!

## How to install
If you want to play this game you have two options:
1. Clone the repository to your machine. 
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Open "index.html" in your browser.

If the game does not run, try clearing your cache.

## How to play
Move by using arrow keys. If you hit the walls, naturally you can't go beyond. If you get to the top, you will score 10 points and move back to starting position. 

## How to win
You win the game if you reach 100 points. You gain 10 points each time you hit the water row. You also gain 10 points from hearts if you already have full lives.

## Losing the game
You lose the game if you get hit three times by the bugs. Those will eat you.

## Notes
1. Bugs' speed updates randomly each time they hit the right end of the board.
2. Hearts will pop up randomly. If you manage to get to the heart, you will gain +1 life.
